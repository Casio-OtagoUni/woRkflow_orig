# The woRkflow Workshop

1 hour (hopefully)

## To do before you come

 * install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
 * make sure you can log in to [git.soton.ac.uk](git.soton.ac.uk/)
 * check you have an ssh key set up for the laptop/PC/server where you are going to use RStudio
 * Make sure you have Teams - we will be using the screen sharing a lot

## On the day we will

 * fork the [woRkflow repo](https://git.soton.ac.uk/SERG/workflow) to your personal space on git.soton.ac.uk
 * clone your personal fork of the repo to the laptop/PC/server where you are going to use RStudio 
 * explore the repo to see what is in:
   * /R
   * .env.R
   * /Rmd
 * test /Rmd/make_basicReport.R and see why it doesn't work
 * build the repo as a R package
 * re-test /Rmd/make_basicReport.R to see if it works now
 * work through /Rmd/make_basicReport.R to understand:
   * what drake is doing and how it helps
   * why data.table is really fast
   * why lubridate is so useful for dates and times
   * how to get ggplot2 to make pretty plots
  
 * That's it :-)
