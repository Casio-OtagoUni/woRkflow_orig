## docs

The place to put the **output** of your analysis code - see [template info](../template.md).

Why?

 * it means you collect all your outputs and plots in one place so they're easy to find. If you name them sensibly...
 * [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) use /docs as one of the default folders to publish from. If that means nothing to you, don't worry. git.soton.ac.uk doesn't support 'pages' (yet). We asked but the said no.
