## analysis

The place to put your analysis code - see [template info](../template.md).

In most cases we use:

 * make_xxxx.R <- where we do all the heavy lifting and output object creation via drake and then render...
 * xxx.Rmd <- where we report the output objects. The results go in [docs/](../docs/)
