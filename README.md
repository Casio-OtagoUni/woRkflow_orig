How we do collaborative reproducible data analysis and reporting. Mostly (but not only) using R. Inspired by [@AlexaLFH](https://twitter.com/AlexaLFH/status/1261633918782013440).

This repo does two things:

 * it is a collection of [resources](resources.md)
 * it is a [template](template.md) repo that illustrates how we work

If you like how we work and want to use the repo as a tmeplate, simply fork and go.
