# woRkflow

How we do collaborative reproducible data analysis and reporting. Mostly (but not only) using R. Inspired by [@AlexaLFH](https://twitter.com/AlexaLFH/status/1261633918782013440).

This repo does three things:

 * it is a collection of R [how-to resources](resources.md);
 * it is a [template](template.md) repo that illustrates how we work and which you can copy;
 * it is an R package that you can build if you want to (not that is has many useful functions).

If you like how we work and want to use the repo as a template for your project or package, just [fork and go](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html).
