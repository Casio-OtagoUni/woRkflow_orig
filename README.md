How we do collaborative reproducible data analysis and reporting. Mostly (but not only) using R. Inspired by [@AlexaLFH](https://twitter.com/AlexaLFH/status/1261633918782013440).

This repo does two things:

 * it is a collection of [resources](resources.md) including some notes on:
   * how to [use git branches](gitBranches.md) 
 * it is a [template](template.md) repo that illustrates how we work

If you want to [contribute to the repo](contributing.md) or like how we work and want to use it as a template, simply [fork and go](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html).
